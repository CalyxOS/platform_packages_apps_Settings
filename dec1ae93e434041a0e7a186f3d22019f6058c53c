      "message": "I like the idea of removing it from Settings, but then we need to add the Unrestricted data toggle to Datura.\n\nAnother idea is to use the pre-QPR2 behavior in DataSaverBackend.java - perhaps literally just check it out from pre-QPR2 - and not even use the new DynamicDenylistManager at all, whose purpose I\u0027m struggling to understand. It has a method to reset the denylist on boot (seemingly to undo user changes to the background network access setting?). That looks like its main purpose, but 1) I don\u0027t think we want that, and 2) it doesn\u0027t seem like it\u0027s working.",

Let\u0027s maybe figure it out and fix it in a follow-up build. Impact should be low keeping it as-is imo.",
