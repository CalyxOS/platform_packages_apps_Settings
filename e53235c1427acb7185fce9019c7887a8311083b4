      "message": "This is working fine on a signed -user build (with If09b5bd4) with Safest. Can enable, reboot, disable, reboot, no hiccups, despite being RestrictedSwitchPreference instead of SwitchPreference. Confirmed that `fastboot flashing unlock` works, or doesn\u0027t work, depending on the setting.\n\nReminder that you do not need to enter a PIN to turn OEM unlocking off, just as is the case in Developer Options. (This is fine/expected)",
