At this point, \"New profile\" is in the list but greyed out, and the navigation bar (3 button) seems to have blanked (which might be unrelated)\n6. Go home anyway\n7. See work profile in Launcher (no internet, don\u0027t have the latest networking patches)\n8. F-Droid privext not working, likely didn\u0027t get installed?\n9.
