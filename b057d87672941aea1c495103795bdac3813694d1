      "message": "The concern here is that bug reports may contain sensitive info, and now it\u0027s just a button away.\n\nDeveloper options required pin confirmation. OEM unlocking requires it\u0027s own additional pin confirmation, maybe we can duplicate that here?\n\nEither way it\u0027s still reliant on user action, and it just takes a bugreport - the actual sharing also has to be done by the user, apps can\u0027t just access bugreports taken.",

      "message": "There is also a warning dialog when you try to share them, and the same warning message appears as a header message when accessing Files \u003e Bug Reports. [Warning text](https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/android-13.0.0_r16:frameworks/base/packages/Shell/res/values/strings.xml;l\u003d45): \"Bug reports contain data from the system\u0027s various log files, which may include data you consider sensitive (such as app-usage and location data). Only share bug reports with people and apps you trust.\"\n\nThe only downside I can think of is that the user can opt to never see the warning dialog again; the checkbox defaults unchecked on user builds, fortunately (checked on debug builds). They can also dismiss the message in Files \u003e Bug reports by tapping OK, but it will return next time they access that section.\n\nPersonally I\u0027d be okay with worth moving forward with this as-is.",
