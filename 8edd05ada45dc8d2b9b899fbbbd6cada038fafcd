      "message": "Works! Still needs UI. Currently, testing involves the following:\n- Set work hours in Settings \u003e Passwords, ... \u003e Work \u003e Work profile settings as usual.\n- Change the mode with `adb shell settings --lineage --user 10 put user_activity_end_time_mode 1`\n- Wait until the appointed hour.\n\nWhen that time is reached, the profile stops, and a notification appears - still associated with the stopped profile (has briefcase) - that says \"End of work day\". The notification does nothing when tapped.\n\nApart from putting in a mode selector, the above also needs adjustments / string change / something.",
